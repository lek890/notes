# Stockholm, Sweden

Sweden is on of the countries that rank higher in the happiness index. And it is one of the scandinavian countries - Sweden, Finland and Denmark. They are like sisters who loves each other very much. And it is one of the countries where you can see the Northern Lights. How cool is that :)

Welcome to Stockholm,the capital city, where mobile communication was born. Stockholm airport welcomed us with a good weather and we rode a bus from airport to Stockholm city central.

Most part of Stockholm is archipelago and you walk many bridges jumping from island to island. The water is so clean and green.

We grabbed breakfast from Brot & Salt and walked towards the Vasa meuseum. There are a lot of meuseums in Stockholm and it is one of the main attraction. Most public meuseums are free to enter. And in private meuseums, if you are below a certain age, you get free entrance. How cool is that? Children should have access to meuseums.

## Vasa meuseum

What awaitaed us is a magnificent war ship of 1800's that laid under the sea for 300 years and now put to display. The ships name is Vasa.

Vasa has two rows of decks which has openings to shoot out with large guns. The king of Sweden was fighting a war at Poland and ordered workers back at home to build a magnificent war ship to fight war in style ;).

He wanted to show off the strength of his empire and so he sent designs from Poland for a magnificant war ship. The work of the ship started in Stockholm. The ship had a hell lot of gold ornamentals, carved scluptures and a huge lion sculpture to show the wrath of the king. (Irony - there are no lions in Sweden anytime. He just wanted to scare the enemy depicting him as a lion). 

Most designs in the ship shows the king as the man of god, gaurded by angels, to induce an impression that the king was someone to be feared. There are many scary sculptures of animals and wierd creatures to induce fear in the enemy.
The ship was painted in bright colors and was spectacular to see.

The King kept pressurising the workers to finish the work fast and they did their job in a haste.

Then what happened? The sailing day of the ship was a day of celebration for the people. There was a big crew onboard and thousands of people was ashore waving off the ship. But sadly, as for titanic, that was Vasa's first and last journey. The ship sailed into the sea and couldn't balance a strong wind that blew and it started sinking on its side. Water rushed in, sinking it more. Some people escaped, most died. 

What was the problem? In those days, ships were balanced using rounded stones in its base. For a proper balancing, there has to be a proper width for the base. With more design changes sent by the king and the rushed work, this width was less for the size of the ship. When the wind tilted the ship, the stones rolled to one side and the ship just sank.

What happened after that? Well, an inquiry was held to find what went wrong and everyone just blamed the one above them. The chief designer of the ship was a Dutch man and he actually died an year ago. On the final hearing, he was held accountable for the faulty design. Alright, no swedish men were found guilty. Poor dutch guy.

Another ship which was designed alongside Vasa lived for 30 years fighting very well in the wars that happened later. Vasa lied under sea for 300 years and then was taken out 1960's. Since then she is preserved and studied curiously. 

One interesting picture found at the meuseum is this. From the studies, it felt women played a major role in the society at that time. But no one wrote about them. And find them from the scriptures and journals at that time is depicted in this picture. It is a nice one.

## City Center

City center has a niced pavement with lion sculptures here and there and was very crowded. Shops of all kinds. All I was interested is in some Indian restaurents on the way :D

We spend the evening walking around the city - the view of the city from a long distance was nice.

We wrapped the day with some food from a south indian restaurent.

## Moderne meuseum

I love to see art in any form and contemporary art meuseums are one of my favourite places. Have you felt the way your brain feels when you see perspectives you have never thought of? I don't click pictures mostly in meuseums unless to read the descriptions later, so there are not much pictures here. 

## Exploring the city

We got a day ticket for us and got into a boat and went until it reached its last stop and came back in the city metro. Then we got into a bus and went until its end and saw how the city was like. Very unconventional travelling it is.

## Royal palace

Sweden is still under the rule of a King. Royal palace was royal, I should say. The crowns in the treasuries are so so so beautiful. The palace had audio tour with RFID devices and it was very informative. 

The House of Bernadette was found in Sweden and they are still ruling. This was the most richest palace I have seen until this day. They just decorated it so classy and manginficant. Even today, when foreign ambassidors arrive, the tourist visits will be stopped and the Palace would be functioning again. 

## The Old palace

The old palace of 1500s was mostly underground, built with bricks and it was a different experience. It would be anything of a house in India nowadays but was a palace in 1500s. This palace got a fire and later the Royal palace was built.

And back home to beautiful Hamburg :)

## My year 

I am so grateful to live my life in beautiful places like Hamburg and Wedel. Its so close to nature, still modern in all aspects. I have changed so much after I came to Hamburg. 

I have been depressed for long when I was in India. I had personal and financial problems. I just got used to living in a survival mode for long. I never felt happy for long. Whatever came across me, I never gave up. I don't do it intentionally, but that just became a second nature for me. 

From childhood, I never talked my problems to anybody. I just managed them on my own and that just gave me a nature of being alone. May be, that eventually made me an intorvert. I just lived on an auto pilot.

I had insomnia for long. I has anxiety problems. It was hard. I just lived in an auto pilot mode.

I travelled alone from India to Germany, first time being in an aeroplane. It was winter when I arrived. 

He pushed me out on the second day I arrived, to go to the Indian Consulate alone. But from there on, I picked up this place.

I spend days curling up near the heater and applying for jobs. I made it into a job the next month.

This place has been so kind to me. I started sleeping better. 

People judged less. Even strangers said 'moin' in the hamburg way, in the morning. Said Tschuss when they left. At least, they said 'Bis spater' when leaving the room :D. They said 'Gesunheit' when you sneezed. People I met in a lift said Tschuss when they were leaving. It felt nice.

Two months later I arrived, spring started. And it was all beautiful outside. We went for walks. Flowers lifted the spirit up. We walked, walked and I just felt better. 

When people come out to walk their dogs, they just come near you and people allow you to pet them. It was nice. 

They show 'Shaun the sheep' in the train. He is my sweetheat <3.

We lived in a single room home for 6 months. It was small but was enough for us. When we moved later to a 3 room home, we felt it like a playground. We didn't know what to with the extra space. Now we occupied every inch of it though. We got house plants. We lit up candles that smelled nice.

My worries came back to me at times, one at a time. They stayed for some days and left me and never came back. As if they were saying goodbye to me. I felt better.

We went walking, around the Alster lake. A full round was 7km. We walked around it 2 3 times a week. We usually saw many ducks and swans around it. Then they were gone. Then they came back with small babies. They walked around. Then the parents guided them to swim. Then they grew into big ones. It was nice to see. 

We went to pick strawberries once. We ate more than what we picked. We tossed fresh milk into it, made smoothies.

Then it was summer. It was all sunny, people wore short dresses. Sun went down very late at night. People barbecued. People threw a sheet on the grass in the park and read, slept in the sun. Their dogs played happily around. People did kayaking in the canals. They did standup peddaling. They took their boats to Alster. And some rich ones flew some planes overhead. They did what ever they could do. We walked, watching everything all along Hamburg.

Flu hit me. Then I recovered.

And we went to Norway in may. We went to the Pulpit rock. We saw the glacier river flowing peacefully. We saw the fjords. I met many cat friends there. We slept in a beautiful airBnB. It was a cute home. Norway is the beautiful place I have ever been to.

Then we came back. We planned for Amsterdam for his birthday. But, we had to go home. One of our parent perished. We cried. A lot. We consoled each other.

We came back. We started cancelling the Amsterdam reservations. But we needed a change terribly. So we rebooked the cancelled reservations and got on the plane.

Amsterdam was like a gypsey with a weed in hand. It was full of cycles. You know them right? They have more cycles than their population. We walked around the city. We rested. We went to Haarlem - a nearby city. She was beautiful. That month we walked almost 100km.

We came back home. We kept walking. We went to a park in Hamburg. It had the tombs of the soldiers of world war. I felt blank. It was 1000's of tombs.

Later, we went to Berlin. Saw the berlin wall. Saw how people reacted to building a wall across their hearts, leaving their loved ones on the other side.
And saw how Berlin wall collapsed, uniting everyone. 

When I walk to office, I walk over many stones with names on it. It was the jews who lived in that house who perished, you know how. It's a reminder to not hate anyone.

Then, Lunegerg heide bloomed. All in pink. It was so healing and relaxing to be there.

Then fall came, leaves turned yellow. Then orange. Halloween came. Pumpkins arrived. 

Then gluhwine started to boil making the rooms smell sweet. Heat the wine with spices, you have the gluhwine. Until christmas arrived, gluhwine kept us sane. 

November came. Santaclaus shaped chocolate everywhere now. We munched on santaclauses and roamed in the chirstmas markets. Drank gluh wine, ate small cakes called smalshkuchen, went on rides, bought small beautiful things.

Decemeber came. Flu hit me. I recovered. Then we flew out to Belgium for christmas. Brussels - the gastronomic capital. So, if you think french fries is french, nope its from Belgium. We ate waffles. Walked. Saw the little mannequin who is pissing for centuries now.

We watched the light show at the grand palace. Stood inside a sea of light bulbs that you can touch in the play area. We walked miles to savour on Dosa and Idli from a indian restaurant. 

We went to atomium. If Effiel tower is for Paris, Atomium is for Belgium. 
Good bye to Belgium.

Back to Hamburg. My beautiful little place. 

If I look back, I have changed a lot in this one year. Still I am saying goodbye to left over stressors, one at a time. But I know I am walking with the right person, finding my missing pieces along the way and putting them back to be whole again someday :)
