Sapiens - A brief history of humankind

I want to write about the progress I make with
this book, without explaining it, just noting down the points I liked on the chapter I just read.

Apr 23, 2020

I read the first chapter today. The points that sticks with me are these - 

1. we often think of us as the only humans
When we, Home Sapiens (Wise Man) emerged in Africa, there were other humans living in others parts of the world.
The Neanderthals (Man from the Neanderthal valley) were in Europe. The Homo Erectus(Upright Man) were Eastern Asia. 
The Homo Floresienis (Man from the Flores island) lived in small islands of Indonesia. 
And there are Homo Denisova, Homo Ergaster etc etc.

But they all, at times perished. Either by mixing with Home Sapiens or they lost in the competition for resources with the 
much competent Home Sapiens or the Home Sapiens just killed them. 

2. The words species and genus makes more sense now
Species is a group which can breed and produce fertile offsprings.
Horses and Donkeys can interbreed but the offspring mule is not fertile. But Bulldogs and Spaniels can breed and 
give a fertile offspring. And they belong to the same species.

Species that evolved from a common ancesstor are bunched together under the name genus. 
We sapiens are of species Sapiens in the genus Homo. 

3. Cooking and cost of thinking
When a human spend an hour a day to chew his cooked food, a chimpanzee spends 3-5 hours chewing raw food. And since man started
eating cooked food, his instestines evolved to be shorter and the energy was diverted to maintaing the brain.
Like a government that diverts money from defence to education, humans diverted energy from biceps to neurons and it
helped in being more powerful when the enemy is physically stronger. The brain is very expensive to maintain. It take 25 percent of the energy even during resting time.
